			<div class="headertext">Mountain Biking.<br></div> 
			Mountain Biking is a great way to enjoy the countryside whilst keeping fit. 
			There are routes which take you up onto the Black Mountains and along the ridges to Hay on Wye or Talgarth, 
			or enjoy the scenic beauty of the Begwyns on the Cambrian range. <br>
			<br>
			We have world class single track routes like the Marin Trail in the Gwydyr forest and Penmachno and other classics like Coed y Brenin and Coed Llandegla.
			We have seen firsthand the dramatic increase in popularity of this exciting, now well-established sport and we're convinced it is here to stay. 
			We are keen to make sure that people enjoy the mountains in a safe and responsible way, allowing them to have even more fun. <br>
			<br>
			What better way to explore the countryside and small villages of the remotest corners of Wales? 
			Our cycling holidays are designed to engage you with your surroundings. 
			Your holiday is enhanced by cycling and your appreciation of the environment and people is heightened by your cycling experience. <br>
			<br>
			Why not try one of our tougher mountain bike weekends, set amidst the magnificent scenery of the Brecon Beacons of Wales. 
			Whilst the biking is not overly technical the routes are fairly long and do involve some road riding. <br>
			<br>
			<b> Bikes are equipped with: </b><br>
			Puncture repair kit & spare inner tube
			<br>
			Pump
			<br>
			Custom made route map
			<br>
			Helmet <br>
			<br>
			All routes are custom made to suit your ability and do involve some road work to get you to the off-road sections. 
			You also have the peace of mind to know that there is a back up service to collect you and your bike from the hills if there is a mechanical breakdown or in the unlikely event of an injury. <br>
