			Discover the countryside in the best way possible - on horseback. 
			There will be a riding assessment on arrival to ensure that no one will feel frustrated or frightened. 
			You will be taken to an ancient woodland to explore the paths and tracks through the valley, some of which incorporate small cross country jumps for the more experienced. <br>
			<br>
			We have a range of horses and ponies and can cater for beginners as well as experienced riders. 
			Rides are available all year round; in the summer we run longer trail rides. 
			We are fortunate to be able to access a wide variety of excellent bridleways, forestry, hills and moor land trails, affording stunning scenery and fantastic riding. <br>
			<br>
			Whatever your standard - even if you have never been on a horse before - we can get you started. <br>
			<br>
			Riding is a great way to get out into the mountains and see much more. <br>
			<br>
			Pony trekking means a quiet ride on a quiet pony or horse. 
			You will ride at your own comfort level, but there is a chance to branch off and trot or canter in the right places. <br>
			<br>
			Our horses and ponies are well mannered and sensible and are suitable for the complete novice, as well as the accomplished rider. 
			Instruction is provided for those who require it and we are happy to help you build confidence and improve you riding skills in a relaxed and informal atmosphere, where the emphasis is on enjoyment. <br>
